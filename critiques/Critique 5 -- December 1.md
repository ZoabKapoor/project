Note: I don't see a code repository yet, so I'll assume you haven't started writing code/don't have your code on git yet. All that
remains to comment on this week is your notebook itself. I've also looked at some of your previous documents for context. 

I think the data model you've proposed looks pretty good. My main suggestion for you as we grow close to the end of the semester is as follows: 
write some code! While good design is certainly very important, I think you've thought about this enough that you have a 
reasonably optimal language design; now focus on making an implementation
(regardless of whether or not it's the optimal one) and iterating on that implementation. You may be skilled enough at software development
that this won't take you that long (I know I certainly wasn't :stuck_out_tongue:) but getting a preliminary implementation written will
provide you with something concrete to modify and improve.
One other thing I would suggest is using example driven development. I haven't been able to find an example program's structure and 
semantics anywhere in your project repositories; I think if you write out a concrete example program and what it does it will guide your
implementation of the parser, intermediate representation, and semantics of your language.

Good luck!
